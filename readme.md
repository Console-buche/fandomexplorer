# Fandom Explorer

Started this in ~2023. Idea was to have a sort of hub to switch between various fandoms (dagon ball z, rick and morty, etc.)

## Why?

Started out as a personal tribute to a show I love.
Techwise, wanted to explore displaying a ton of images using atlases.
Also wanted to try out zustand.

## Features

- 3D scene with interactive cockpit
- Search for characters by name
- Click their status to navigate between their ring.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. `pnpm install`

## Project Status

WIP and on hold. Haven't touched in a while, fell into other rabbit holes...

# Notes

yep just testing my agent!
